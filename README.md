# Server-Side-API-Weather-Dashboard

As a traveler, I would like to see the weather for multiple cities at any given time, so that I can plan my trip accordingly.

The following are the fuctions I would need on the Weather Dashboard:

-Weather dashboard with form inputs
-Search box for a city that shows current and future conditions for a specific city - The city is then added to the search history.
-The function to view current weather conditions for that city - I am then presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
-When I view the UV index, I will be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
-When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
-When I click on a city in the search history, I will once again be presented with current and future conditions for that city
